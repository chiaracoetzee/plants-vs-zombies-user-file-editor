Plants vs. Zombies user file editor
===================================

The user file in Plants vs. Zombies contains data about your progress in the game, money,
unlocked modes, trophies, achievements, purchased items, plants in your Zen Garden, and
your Zombatars. By directly modifying the user file you can change any of these things,
and do certain things that are either very difficult (like earning $999,990) or not
possible in the game (like having Corn Cobs in your Zen Garden).

This tool (written in C# on Windows) makes it easy to modify the user file of the PC version
of Plants vs. Zombies. This enables a variety of cheats. It automatically creates backups of
your user file, so it is safe to use. It currently only supports a specific version of the
user file format (version 12 or 0x0C) but more versions can be added in the future.

For details of the user file format used to create this tool and screenshots, see:
